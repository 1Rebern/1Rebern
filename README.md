A project I decided to develop in my spare time.

The goal of the project was to test my skills and create an assistant for working with computers.

The latest version is quite flexible, but I will continue to improve and develop the project.

Programming language:
* Python.

I developed three libraries for the project:
* [number_to_text_ua](https://github.com/1Rebern/annabelle-voice-assistant-ua/blob/b4bf5c2a84730910915c2596c8fef53ffff4dc06/Lib/number_to_text_ua.py)
* [text_to_number_ua](https://github.com/1Rebern/annabelle-voice-assistant-ua/blob/b4bf5c2a84730910915c2596c8fef53ffff4dc06/Lib/text_to_number_ua.py)
* [time_to_text_ua](https://github.com/1Rebern/annabelle-voice-assistant-ua/blob/b4bf5c2a84730910915c2596c8fef53ffff4dc06/Lib/time_to_text_ua.py)

A course project.

Programming language:
* Python.

Framework:
* Piside6.

Python was chosen because of the large number of custom libraries and easy GUI creation.

After writing the project, I gained knowledge about:
* RSA encryption method.
* Working with Piside6.
* Work with the re module
